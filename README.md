### Hi, i'm Gleb ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Flutter developer and Dart enthusiast. In my free time, I develop Dart packages.

Dart packages developed by me:
 - [theater](https://pub.dev/packages/theater) - actor framework for Dart;
 - [ossa](https://pub.dev/packages/ossa) - simple package for working with multithreading;
 - [emerald](https://pub.dev/packages/emerald) - JSON serializer/deserializer for Dart (JIT only).

Examples of those Flutter applications that I developed:
 - [synword](https://github.com/GlebBatykov/synword-mobile) - mobile application for checking and enhancing the uniqueness of texts;
 - [moneum](https://github.com/GlebBatykov/moneum) - mobile application for cost accounting.
